v1.3



Unity Technologies ApS (“Unity”) grants to you a worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, and royalty-free copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, and distribute the work of authorship that accompanies this License (“Work”), subject to the following terms and conditions:

1. Unity Companion Use. Exercise of the license granted herein is permitted as long as it is in connection with the  authoring and/or distribution of applications, software, or other content under a valid Unity content authoring and rendering engine software license (“Engine License”). That means, for example, as long as you authored content using the Work under an Engine License, you may distribute the Work in connection with that content as you see fit under this License. No other exercise of the license granted herein is permitted, and in no event may the Work be used for competitive analysis or to develop a competing product or service.

2. No Modification of Engine License. Neither this License nor any exercise of the license granted herein modifies the Engine License in any way.

3. Ownership; Derivative Works.

3.1 You own your content. In this License, “derivative works” means derivatives of the Work itself--works derived only from the Work by you under this License (for example, modifying the code of the Work itself to improve its efficacy); “derivative works” of the Work do not include, for example, games, apps, or content that you create with the Work. You keep all right, title, and interest in your own content.

3.2 Unity owns its content. While you keep all right, title, and interest to your own content per the above, as between Unity and you, Unity will own all right, title, and interest to all intellectual property rights (including patent, trademark, and copyright) in the Work and derivative works of the Work, and you hereby assign and agree to assign all such rights in those derivative works to Unity. Should assignment be invalid for any reason, you grant to Unity an irrevocable, perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, and royalty-free license (with the right to grant sublicenses) under those intellectual property rights to those derivative works. You also agree to waive or refrain from asserting any author’s right, moral rights, or like rights to the extent necessary to permit exploitation as contemplated under this License.

3.3 Your right to use derivative works. You will always have the right to use derivative works of the Work you create, consonant with this License.

4. Trademarks. You are not granted any right or license under this License to use any trademarks, service marks, trade names, products names, or branding of Unity or its affiliates (“Trademarks”). Descriptive uses of Trademarks are permitted; see, for example, Unity’s Trademark Guidelines at https://unity3d.com/legal/branding_trademarks.

5. Notices & Third-Party Rights. This License, including the copyright notice associated with the Work, must be provided in all substantial portions of the Work and derivative works thereof (or, if that is impracticable, in any other location where such notices are customarily placed). Further, if the Work is accompanied by a Unity “third-party notices” or similar file, you acknowledge and agree that software or content identified in that file is governed by those separate license terms.

6. DISCLAIMER, LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. THE Work AND ANY DERIVATIVE WORKS THEREOF IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, AND IS PROVIDED WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING ANY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND/OR NON-INFRINGEMENT. IN NO EVENT SHALL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER OR AUTHOR BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES (WHETHER DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL, INCLUDING PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES, LOSS OF USE, DATA, OR PROFITS, AND BUSINESS INTERRUPTION), OR OTHER LIABILITY WHATSOEVER, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM OR OUT OF, OR IN CONNECTION WITH, THE Work OR ANY DERIVATIVE WORKS THEREOF OR THE USE OF OR OTHER DEALINGS IN SAME, EVEN WHERE ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.

7. USE IS ACCEPTANCE and License Versions. Your access to and use of the Work constitutes your acceptance of this License and its terms and conditions. This License may be modified or updated; upon any such modification or update, you will comply with the terms of the updated License for any use of any of the Work under the updated License.

8. Use in Compliance with Law and Termination. Your exercise of the license granted herein will at all times be in compliance with applicable law and will not infringe any proprietary rights (including intellectual property rights); this License will terminate immediately (i) on any breach by you of this License; and (ii) if you commence any form of patent litigation, including a cross-claim or counterclaim, against anyone wherein you allege that the Work constitutes direct or secondary/indirect patent infringement.

9. Severability. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent possible and the other provisions will remain in full force and effect.

10. Governing Law and Venue. This License is governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of Denmark, except for its conflict of laws rules; the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods will not apply. If you reside (or your principal place of business is) within the United States, you and Unity agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of and venue in the state and federal courts located in San Francisco County, California concerning any dispute arising out of this License (“Dispute”). If you reside (or your principal place of business is) outside the United States, you and Unity agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of and venue in the courts located in Copenhagen, Denmark concerning any Dispute.

authority to bind your Entity to all of the terms and conditions of this
License. If you do not have the requisite authority to so bind your Entity, you

or license Developer Content (including your source and object code) or any of
your Developer Modified Utilities Code to Oculus or any third parties;

Oculus may be used to endorse or promote any Developer Content or any other
products, content or materials developed using the Utilities SDK without
specific prior written permission of Oculus.

5.4.   Feedback. You may, but are not obligated to, provide Oculus with comments
or other feedback, suggestions or recommended improvements regarding the
Utilities SDK or any other Oculus products or services (collectively,
“Feedback”). You hereby grant Oculus a worldwide, non-exclusive, perpetual,
irrevocable, royalty-free, fully paid-up, transferable, sublicensable (through
multiple tiers of sublicenses) license to use, disclose, reproduce, modify,
create derivatives of, license, distribute, provide and exploit any Feedback for
any purpose whatsoever, without any obligation, limitation or restriction of any
kind.

6. THIRD PARTY SOFTWARE OR MATERIALS  Your use of any third-party software
(including any open source software) or materials included in the Utilities SDK
may be subject to other terms and conditions typically found in separate
third-party license agreements or "READ ME" files included with such third-party
software or materials. To the extent any of such other terms and conditions
conflict with any of the terms and conditions of this License, such other terms
and conditions applicable to such third-party software or materials will control
solely with respect to such third-party software or materials (but to no other
portion or component of the Utilities SDK).

7. INDEMNIFICATION  You agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless Oculus and
its subsidiaries, agents, contributors, licensors, managers, and other
affiliated companies, and their employees, contractors, agents, officers and
directors, from and against any and all claims, damages, obligations, losses,

such qualifications. The arbitration shall be conducted in accordance with the
rules and procedures of JAMS then in effect, and the judgment of the arbitrator
shall be final and capable of entry in any court of competent jurisdiction. The
parties undertake to keep confidential all awards in their arbitration, together
with all materials in the proceedings created for the purpose of the arbitration
and all other documents produced by another party in the proceedings not
otherwise in the public domain, save and to the extent that disclosure may be
required of a party by legal duty, to protect or pursue a legal right or to
enforce or challenge an award in legal proceedings before a court or other
judicial authority. You and Oculus agree the following may be submitted to a
court of competent jurisdiction located within San Francisco, California and
further agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located
within San Francisco, California in connection with (a) any entrance of an
arbitrator's judgment or decision, (b) any dispute with respect to the
arbitration process or procedure, (c) Oculus’ exercise of any of its equitable
rights or remedies or (d) any claims regarding the ownership, validity,
enforceability and/or infringement of any intellectual property rights.

11.2.  Class Action/Jury Waiver.  WITH RESPECT TO ALL PERSONS AND ENTITIES,
REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THEY HAVE OBTAINED OR USED THE UTILITIES SDK FOR PERSONAL,
COMMERCIAL OR OTHER PURPOSES, ALL CLAIMS MUST BE BROUGHT IN THE PARTIES’
INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED
CLASS ACTION, COLLECTIVE ACTION, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION OR OTHER
REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. THIS WAIVER APPLIES TO CLASS ARBITRATION, AND, UNLESS
WE AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S
CLAIMS. YOU AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THIS LICENSE, YOU AND OCULUS ARE EACH
WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION,
COLLECTIVE ACTION, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION, OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE
PROCEEDING OF ANY KIND.

11.3.  License Suspension. If you file a suit or initiate a proceeding with or
before a governmental authority in which you challenge Oculus’ ownership of any
intellectual property rights related to the Utilities SDK or the validity or
enforceability of any such intellectual property rights (a “Claim”), the
licenses granted to you under this License shall automatically and immediately
(upon the filing of such suit or proceeding) be suspended. Such suspension will
continue until all such Claims asserted by you are dismissed, withdrawn or are
finally settled and no longer pending, as applicable, in which case, such
licenses will be automatically reinstated; provided, however, that such
reinstatement will not release you from any liabilities, or remedies therefor,
that arise during the period of such suspension.

12.    OTHER PROVISIONS

12.1.  Changes to the SDK. Oculus may discontinue or change functionality of the
Utilities SDK at any time, and your continued use of the Utilities SDK or use of
any modified or additional Utilities SDL is conditioned upon your adherence to
the terms of this License, as modified by Oculus from time to time in accordance
with Section 12.2.

12.2.  Updates to License. Oculus may revise and update this License at any time
by posting the amended terms and conditions of this License (“Updated License
Terms”) to: https://developer.oculus.com/licenses/. Your continued use of the
Utilities SDK or any portion or component of the Utilities SDK constitutes your
acceptance of the Updated License Terms. If there are Updated License Terms for
any future release of the Utilities SDK, you: (a) agree to comply with all terms
and conditions of such Updated License Terms for such future Utilities SDK
release and (b) acknowledge and agree that such Updated License Terms will apply
to all Developer Content that may be developed using or incorporating such
future Utilities SDK or any portion or component of the Utilities SDK (for
example, without limitation, you cannot avoid complying with the terms and
conditions of such Updated License Terms by developing any Developer Content
using or incorporating any release of the Utilities SDK that precedes such
future Utilities SDK or under any version of this License that precedes such
Updated License Terms).

12.3.  Export Law Compliance. You will comply, and will not cause Oculus to not
comply (by for example, providing Developer Content to Oculus under this
Agreement for which required export clearances have not been obtained), with all
applicable export control laws of the United States and any other applicable
governmental authority, including without limitation, the U.S. Export
Administration Regulations.

12.4.  Confidentiality.  You agree that (a) the Utilities SDK and all
documentation or other information or materials provided or made available by or
for Oculus are Oculus’ confidential information and (b) you will not use,
disclose or make available any of such Oculus confidential information to any
third party except as expressly permitted under, and in accordance with, the
terms and conditions of this License.

12.5.  Relationship of the Parties. The parties hereto are independent
contractors. Neither party has any express or implied right or authority to
assume or create any obligations on behalf of the other or to bind such other
party to any contract, agreement or undertaking with any third party. Nothing in
this License shall be construed to create a partnership, joint venture,
employment or agency relationship.

12.6.  Assignment. You may not assign this License or any licenses or rights
granted under this License or delegate any obligations under this License, in
each case, without the advance written consent of Oculus, which may be withheld
in its sole discretion. Any attempted assignment by you without such advance
written consent of Oculus will be null and void. Oculus may assign this License
or any licenses or rights granted under this License or delegate any obligations
under this License in its sole discretion, in each case, without your consent or
any notice to you. This License shall be binding on, inure to the benefit of,
and be enforceable by the parties and their respective heirs, successors and
permitted assigns.

12.7.  Severability. In the event that any provision of this License is held to
be null, void, invalid or unenforceable by a court, other governmental body or
arbitration tribunal, in each case of competent jurisdiction, you and Oculus
agree (a) such provision will be modified to the extent necessary to allow it to
be valid and enforceable to the extent permitted by applicable law, provided
that such modification reflects as nearly as possible the intentions of the
parties when entering into this License and (b) the remaining provisions of this
License shall remain in full force and effect.

12.8.  Headings. The section headings contained in this License are for reference
purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of
this License.

12.9.  No Waiver. Failure of either party at any time to exercise or enforce any
legal right or remedy under this License will not be construed as a waiver of
such provisions or in any way affect the validity of this License or any portion
of this License. No waiver of any provision of this License shall be of any
force or effect unless set forth in a writing signed by an authorized
representative of each party.

12.10. Entire Agreement. This License constitutes the entire agreement between
you and Oculus regarding your use of the Utilities SDK and supersedes and
replaces any prior or contemporaneous agreements, understandings, negotiations
and discussions between you and Oculus regarding your access and use of the
Utilities SDK.</pre>
